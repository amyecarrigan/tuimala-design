It started with a Skype conversation.

A colleague and I were chatting about a career move she had made, and I sort of jokingly told her to think of me if she ever needed to hire anyone. She asked me if I had been watching for jobs available, and I said no, I needed to decide what I wanted to do with my career. She laughed and said she didn’t know what she wanted to be when she grew up.

And it hit me. I knew what I wanted to be when I grew up. I had known for a while.

I wanted to be a surface designer.

I had been working on getting better at watercolor for several years, and I always come back to botanicals because they’re my favorite, always beautiful and always different. But I knew I wasn’t really interested in being a “high artist” who only produces original work for the purpose of showing in galleries. I was always really inspired by the art that finds its way on to plates and journals and fabric and towels.

So, I did what any sane person would do, I googled how to become a surface designer.

A class popped up on [Creative Live](https://refer.creativelive.com/s/blovdprincess10) (<- my referral link – search for “pattern design”) taught by [Molly Hatch](https://www.mollyhatch.com/). I had followed her on Instagram for quite some time and adore her style and how she translated her fine art career into fantastic surface design.

Her techniques really struck a chord with me, so I set out on a daily pattern design challenge. I set no particular end date in mind, I just wanted to see how far I could go.
